# Heirloom Expenses

A breakdown of how much does it cost to run [Heirloom](https://useheirloom.com). All prices are without taxes.
Note that the price is only low because it's very early and tiny and lots of important parts are missing - like 
a proper database management with backups, CDN for recipe photos, more involved hosting, email solution, etc.
